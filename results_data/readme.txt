The data for each system is held in a file called [System][periodtype] where period type is either AR, after refactoring or NR No refactoring. 
e.g. FrescoAR contains the data for the Fresco system after a refactoring period and GlideNR is for the Glide system after a non refactoring period.
See the root level readme for details of how these are written.
